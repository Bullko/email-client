## Hi everyone.

This is my first project in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

The first time I did it in typescript and at the same time tried [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and components from [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/).

As an example, I took the look of the [email](https://ui.shadcn.com/examples/mail) client from shadcn. I built the client from the ground up and for example from shadcn I only used data from emails.

For now, Inbox and Starred are working, where you can add or remove mail from Starred. Contacts also work, where you can view the contact and edit its data. U can also edit your profile as firstname, surename and theme.

The rest of the function is still a work in progress. The mobile display is only partially functional.
